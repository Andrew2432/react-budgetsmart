### About
This is a React version of my previous project called [BudgetSmart](https://github.com/Andrew2432/BudgetSmart) which is developed using vanilla JS.

It tracks your current expense. The data is stored securely in local storage.

It uses core concepts such as Context API. The application is tested using Snapshot testing written in Jest.
